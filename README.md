Last safety net to reset OKTA passwords for HIPAA requirements

To set this for your service:

1. Add your API TOKEN to line 5
2. Add your base_url to line 7 -- it looks like dev-###.okta.com/api/v1
3. Set whatever HIPAA trigger you want on line 12
4. Put in your own redirect URL in line 119 for error capture
5. put in your own HIPAA logging directive for line 64
